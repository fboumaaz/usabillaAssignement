# RatingDashboard

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.2.4.
# Step 1: Install the Angular CLI

Install the Angular CLI globally.

To install the CLI using npm, open a terminal/console window and enter the following command:
`npm install -g @angular/cli`

# Step 2:
Go to the workspace folder 

`cd RatingDashboard`

# Step 3:

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:1337/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

#step 4

install `Allow-Control-Allow-Origin: *` extension
because the https bloc localhost requests
so to test the application in local install the extension
